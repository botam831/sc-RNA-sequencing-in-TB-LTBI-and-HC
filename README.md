using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the immune responses of specific immune cell subpopulations to Mtb infection.
PBMCs from HC, LTBI, and TB patients were subjected to scRNA-seq. Clustering  was  performed  using  the  scanpy ,  t-SNE  was  used   for  data visualization, cell-cell communication analysis was conducted, and flow cytometry validated the cell subpopulations identified by scRNA-seq.
Cell-cell communication analysis showed that in HC group, NK and NKT cells acted as strong signaling senders interacting with other immune cells. Conversely, monocytes were the primary signal senders in TB group, interacting  strongly with other immune cells.
